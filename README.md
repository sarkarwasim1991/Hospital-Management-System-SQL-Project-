# 🏥 Hospital Management System (SQL Project)

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to design and query a **Hospital Management System** database using SQL.  
It models real-world hospital operations such as managing patients, doctors, appointments, treatments, and billing.  
The goal is to practice SQL skills and showcase the ability to build normalized databases with constraints and meaningful queries.

4. **Treatments** → Stores treatments linked to appointments, including cost  
5. **Billing** → Handles hospital billing and payment status
